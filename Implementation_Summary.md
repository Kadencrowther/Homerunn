# Progress Bar Implementation Summary

We've successfully implemented progress bars across all screens in the onboarding flow to give users a clear visual indication of their progress through the signup process.

## Screens with Progress Bars

1. **UserInfoScreen** - Step 1/10
   - First screen in the onboarding flow
   - Shows initial progress (10%)

2. **PersonalPreferencesScreen** - Step 2/10
   - Collects user preferences
   - Shows 20% progress

3. **TimeframeScreen** - Step 3/10
   - Captures user's timeframe for purchasing
   - Shows 30% progress

4. **AgentScreen** - Step 4/10
   - Asks if user is working with an agent
   - Shows 40% progress

5. **LocationScreen** - Step 5/10
   - Collects user's desired location
   - Shows 50% progress

6. **ReviewScreen** - Step 6/10

10. **CongratulationsScreen** - Step 10/10
    - Final screen congratulating the user
    - Shows 100% progress (completed)

## Implementation Details

For each screen, we:

1. Imported the `ProgressBar` component
2. Defined constants for the current step and total steps
3. Added the progress bar to the top of the screen layout
4. Ensured consistent styling across all screens

## Style Consistency

We standardized the progress bar container styling across all screens with:

```javascript
progressContainer: {
  paddingTop: height * 0.06,
  paddingBottom: height * 0.02,
},
```

## Next Steps

Potential improvements for the future:

1. Add animations to the progress bar when transitioning between screens
2. Allow users to tap on the progress bar to navigate back to previous steps
3. Add step labels beneath the progress bar for better context
4. Consider different progress indicators for different user flows
